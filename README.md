# Market-Basket-Analysis

**Summary**

Blackwell Electronics is considering acquiring Electronidex (a start-up electronics online retailer), the board directors have asked us to perform some analysis to better understand the clientele that Electronidex is currently serving and if it would be an optimal partnership.

The analysis is based on a csv file contains 30 days of sales transactions, 9835 rows (transactions) and 125 columns (item labels). This analysis is conducted using Basket Analysis to show the association rules between items to reflect the relationship between products / transactions ( also indicate customer purchase pattern). 


**Analysis**

Item Frequency

The Item Frequency plot shows the frequency of products were bought by customers in a descending order. In this case, iMac was the most frequent item bought by customers, Apple Wireless Keyboard was the least frequent item that customers bought. The quantity sold for the most frequent 3 items are: iMac- 2519, HP Laptop - 1909, Cyberpower Gamer Desktop - 1809.

This also implies that rearranging the locations of these items may attract customers to buy more related products: for instance moving the less frequent bought item such as HP Monitor near the most frequent bought item (iMac / HP Laptop etc.).


Association Rules
The Apriori Algorithm was applied to evaluate Association Rules based on the following three measurements:

**Support** - measures the frequency of rules apply to datasets

**Confidence** - measures the accuracy of the rules

**Lift** - measures the importance of a rule


A rule that measures high in both support and confidence produces a strong rule, a high value for lift strongly indicates that the rule is important. 

605 rules were generated by setting a support threshold of 0.001 and confidence of 0.5,  below are the graphs that show the top 10 rules returned by support, confidence and lift. 


**Association Rules generated by Support (top 10 rules)**

The support rule column is highlighted in bold, the top cell shows that 53% of the transactions are bought together which include items from LHS column and RHS column. It takes the max count of 52 rules, however, the confidence and lift value are not the highest from each category which may indicate the lower reliability of this rule. 



**Association Rules generated by Confidence (top 10 rules)**

Above graph shows the confidence level which is highlighted in bold, the top cell interprets the highest confidence level of 90% that customers purchase items from LHS column, they will also purchase item from RHS column. One more item iMac appeared in the LHS column, which didn’t when the support rule was generated. It also produces the highest lift value, however, the support and count value are not the greatest. 


**Association Rules generated by Lift (top 10 rules)**

The lift rule column returns the highest value of 4.65, which suggests that the probability of LHS and RHS items occurring in this rule is high, since it is over 1. This rule also produces the highest confidence value, but the support and count value are lower.  Since both confidence and lift create higher value for rules generated by confidence and lift, we could reply more on these two rules, but not the support rule on its own.

 
The following graphs further explains the relationship between items.

The plot on the left illustrates the relationship between the different metrics. When the lift rule is stronger, it has greater confidence value but lower support value; the weaker lift rules were lied on bottom left corner of confidence and support boundary. 

The plot on the right displays more relationships between Acer Aspir, HP Laptop, ViewSoniceMonitor, Dell Desktop and iMac, these items match with the products that were generated by association rules which was previously explained. The bigger size of the circle represents the higher level of confidence associated with the rule, and the blue circle indicates a higher lift level. All the bigger / brighter circles are located around these five items which also means that these items were frequently bought together than other products. 


**Conclusions**

Blackwell could benefit from selling Electronidex’s items as when customers purchase one item, they also tend to purchase several other items together; Blackwell may start promotions  on related items like wireless keyboards / mouses as customer prefer to buy more desktops / laptops. 
The analysis is only based on 30 days of sales figure, this might not be enough data to study to make a rational decision of acquisition at this point.
More desktops / laptops are sold at one transaction, this could indicate a small business or growing up family as their main customer group, Blackwell could reward customers with free or reduced price of items like Microsoft Office or 3-Button Mouse. They may also consider to reduce the price of other brand desktops / laptops to attract more potential customers. 




**Additional Points:**

Support. This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears.

Confidence. This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}.
One drawback of the confidence measure is that it might misrepresent the importance of an association. This is because it only accounts for how popular apples are, but not beers. If beers are also very popular in general, there will be a higher chance that a transaction containing apples will also contain beers, thus inflating the confidence measure. To account for the base popularity of both constituent items, we use a third measure called lift.

Lift. This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is
